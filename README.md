    name: "GroupClient",
    url: "https://contactservice.bundesimmo.de/api/groups",
    contentType: "application/vnd.api+json",
  });
```


#### Example Client with customization

```
import Shark from "bima-shark-sdk";

class GroupClient {
  constructor() {
    this.client = new Shark.Client({
      name: "GroupClient",
      url: "https://contactservice.bundesimmo.de/api/groups",
      contentType: "application/vnd.api+json",
    });
  }

  search(options = {}) {
    const ids = options.ids || null;
    const canManage = options.canManage || null;
    const data = { filter: {}, include: "creator" };

    if (ids !== null && ids.length === 0) {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { resolve(null); });
    } else if (ids !== null) {
      data.filter["ids"] = ids;
    }

    if (canManage === true) {
      data.filter["can_manage"] = true;
    }

    return this.client.search(data);
  }

  find(id) {
    return this.client.find(id, { include: "creator" });
  }

  create(data) {
    return this.client.create(data, { include: "creator" });
  }

  update(data) {
    return this.client.update(data, { include: "creator" });
  }

  destroy(id) {
    return this.client.destroy(id);
  }
}

export default GroupClient;
```


### Docs

All methods in SDK are documented with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).
You can generate the doc files locally with ` npm run docs ` and have a full-HTML documentation of the SDK in ` /docs `.

Note: If you don't have installed JSDoc already, just run ` npm install -g jsdoc `.


### Testing

This SDK uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) as test framework. Server responses are mocked with [fetch-mock](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/).

```
npm test
```


### About promises

If you add `then` multiple times, you are chaining methods that should be called in sequence, until an exception is thrown.
Exceptions in the then chain must be handled by `catch` declared after the `then`. If there's no `catch` after the `then`, this error will be triggered: `Uncaught (in promise) Error(â€¦)`.

If you add `catch` multiple times, you are chaining methods that should be called when something goes wrong (in the `then` functions before).
However, the second `catch` in the chain will only be called if the first one re-throws the exception, and so forth.
When `catch` is triggered, the chain resumes on the next `then` declared after the `catch`.

The **catch()** method returns a `Promise` and deals with rejected cases only. It behaves the same as calling `Promise.prototype.then(undefined, onRejected)`
(in fact, calling `obj.catch(onRejected)` internally calls `obj.then(undefined, onRejected)`).
